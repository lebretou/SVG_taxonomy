        "Data Extraction": "<input>: An SVG scatter plot with n points. The axes, background, title, legends, and other elements are removed for simplicity. The axes are labeled with their respective scales. The coordinates of the points are defined differently in SVG files, with the origin at the bottom left corner. X increases from left to right, and Y increases from bottom to top (reversed from the SVG definition).\n\n<output>: A comma-separated values (CSV) string with two columns: 'X' and 'Y'. Each row represents the coordinates of a data point. Do not include any other textual answer in your response.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Examine the input SVG scatter plot and identify the axes and their scales.\n2. For each data point in the scatter plot, relate its position to the X and Y axes.\n3. Use the length of the axes and their labeling to compute the coordinate of each data point.\n4. Keep in mind that the origin is at the bottom left corner, X increases from left to right, and Y increases from bottom to top (reversed from the SVG definition).\n5. Extract the precise coordinates of each data point based on the computed values.\n6. Format the extracted coordinates as a CSV string with two columns: 'X' and 'Y'.\n7. Each row in the CSV should represent the coordinates of a single data point.\n8. Do not include any other textual answer in your response besides the CSV string.\n\nPlease provide the CSV string with the coordinates of each data point in the specified format without any additional textual response\n <input SVG scatterplot>:\n.",
        "Filtering": "Can you perform a filtering task on this svg scatter plot? Each data point in this scatter plot is labeled with its corresponding coordinates (X and Y values) For this task, you will color all the data points with a different color that meet some certain criteria. The criteria for this task is (Y > 9) This criteria is based on the labeled values, not the coordinates in the shape definitions of the svg file. Please do so by first extracting the value of each point using their labeled values, correspond the values correctly to each point, then reconstruct the svg according to the task given by coloring the data points satisfying the criteria with a different color. Note that the coordinates of the points are defined differently in svg files, you should keep in mind that bottom left is the origin in our scatterplot. X increases along left to right. Y increases along bottom to top. In other words, the direction Y increase is reversed in svg definition. Do not include any other textual answer in the response, provide the complete svg code. In your response, please  omit the axes, title, legends, and other unimportant elements in the chart. You should just return the data points. Therefore your answer should only include as many data points as the provided svg chart. Please remember to add the definition to the shapes if applicable. ",
        "Clustering": "<input>: An SVG scatter plot with n points. The axes, background, title, legends, and other elements are removed for simplicity.\n\n<output>: SVG code only and no other textual response.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Cluster the points into distinct groups based on their proximity or similarity.\n2. Reconstruct the SVG scatter plot, coloring the points in different clusters with different colors.\n3. Omit the axes, title, legends, and any other unnecessary elements in the reconstructed SVG.\n4. Ensure that the reconstructed SVG contains only the data points, with the same number of points as the input SVG.\n5. Include the necessary shape definitions in the reconstructed SVG code.\n\nPlease provide the complete SVG code for the clustered scatter plot without any additional textual response.\n <input SVG scatterplot>:\n",

The axes, title, legends, and other unnecessary elements are omitted for simplicity.\n\n<output>: SVG code only and no other textual response\n\nInstructions:n1. Identify the outliers in the scatter plot, defined as data points that significantly deviate from the clusters.\n2. Reconstruct the SVG scatter plot, coloring the outliers with a different color compared to the rest of the points.\n3. Omit the axes, title, legends, and any other unnecessary elements in the reconstructed SVG.\n4. Ensure that the reconstructed SVG contains only the data points, with the same number of points as the input SVG.\n5.

        "Find Extremum": "<input>: An SVG scatter plot with n points. The axes, title, legends, and other unnecessary elements are omitted for simplicity.\n\n<output>: SVG code only and no other textual response.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the extremum points in the scatter plot, defined as the data points with the highest and lowest Y values.\n2. Reconstruct the SVG scatter plot, coloring the extremum points with a different color compared to the rest of the points.\n3. Keep in mind that the origin is at the bottom left corner, X increases from left to right, and Y increases from bottom to top (reversed from the SVG definition).\n4. Omit the axes, title, legends, and any other unnecessary elements in the reconstructed SVG.\n5. Ensure that the reconstructed SVG contains only the data points, with the same number of points as the input SVG.\n6. Include the necessary shape definitions in the reconstructed SVG code.\n7.
