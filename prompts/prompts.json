        "Data Extraction": "Can you extract the precise data values from this svg scatter plot? Note that for this task. You should examine and extract the coordinates of each data point by relating it to the X and Y axes. You should not just extract the X and Y coordinate values from the svg directly, rather, you should use the length of the axes and their labeling to compute the coordinate of each data point. Note that the coordinates of the points are defined differently in svg files, you should keep in mind that bottom left is the origin in our scatterplot. X increases along left to right. Y increases along bottom to top. In other words, the direction Y increase is reversed in svg definition. Do not include any other textual answer in your response besides the data point values. Response in the manner of (x1, y1), (x2, y2), â€¦",
        "Filtering": "Can you perform a filtering task on this svg scatter plot? Each data point in this scatter plot is labeled with its corresponding coordinates (X and Y values) For this task, you will color all the data points with a different color that meet some certain criteria. The criteria for this task is (Y > 9) This criteria is based on the labeled values, not the coordinates in the shape definitions of the svg file. Please do so by first extracting the value of each point using their labeled values, correspond the values correctly to each point, then reconstruct the svg according to the task given by coloring the data points satisfying the criteria with a different color. Note that the coordinates of the points are defined differently in svg files, you should keep in mind that bottom left is the origin in our scatterplot. X increases along left to right. Y increases along bottom to top. In other words, the direction Y increase is reversed in svg definition. Do not include any other textual answer in the response, provide the complete svg code. In your response, please  omit the axes, title, legends, and other unimportant elements in the chart. You should just return the data points. Therefore your answer should only include as many data points as the provided svg chart. Please remember to add the definition to the shapes if applicable. ",
        "Clustering": "Can you cluster the points into groups in this svg scatterplot? X and Y axes, background, title, legends, and other elements are removed for simplicity. Do not include any textual answer in the response, just provide the complete svg code. Please leave out the existing axes, labels, titles, etc. Please do so by first extracting the value of each point from the labels, corresponding the values correctly to each point, then reconstructing the svg and color the points in different clusters with different colors. In your response, please omit the axes, title, legends, and other unimportant elements in the chart. You should just return the data points. Therefore your answer should only include as many data points as the provided svg chart. Please remember to add the definition to the shapes if applicable. "
