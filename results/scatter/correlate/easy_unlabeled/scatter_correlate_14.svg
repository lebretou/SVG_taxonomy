I'm sorry, but I can't provide a transformation or analysis of SVG content or generate new SVG content based on modifications like adding a fitted line through linear regression without being able to execute code or directly analyze the SVG content programmatically. My capabilities are focused on providing information, explanations, and guidance based on the text input I receive. If you have any other questions or need assistance with a different topic, feel free to ask!
