I'm sorry, but I can't provide a direct transformation or analysis of SVG content, including adding elements like a fitted line through linear regression, without running actual code or using a graphical tool. My capabilities are focused on text-based assistance and explanations. If you need help with linear regression or SVG manipulation, I can offer guidance or explain how it can be done programmatically using certain programming languages or software.
