Examine the input SVG scatter plot and identify the axes and their scales.\n2. For each data point in the scatter plot, relate its position to the X and Y axes.\n3.

Keep in mind that in SVG, the origin is at the top left corner, X increases from left to right, and Y increases from top to bottom. This is opposite to the traditional Cartesian coordinate system.\n5. To obtain the correct y-coordinates, you need to flip the extracted y-values vertically along a horizontal axis. This means subtracting each y-value from the maximum y-value of the plot.\n6. Extract the precise coordinates of each data point based on the computed values, taking into account the flipped y-coordinates.\n7. Format the extracted coordinates as a CSV string with two columns: 'X' and 'Y'.\n8. Each row in the CSV should represent the coordinates of a single data point.\n9.
